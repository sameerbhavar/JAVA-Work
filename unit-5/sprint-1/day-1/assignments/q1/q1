 Explain difference between PriorityQueue() and LinkedList();
 
 java.util.LinkedList is a doubly-linked list implementation of the List and Deque interfaces. Implements all optional list operations,
  and permits all elements (including null).
  
  java.util.PriorityQueue is an unbounded priority queue based on a priority heap.
   The elements of the priority queue are ordered according to their natural ordering, 
   or by a Comparator provided at queue construction time, depending on which constructor is used. 
   A priority queue does not permit null elements.
   A priority queue relying on natural ordering also does not permit insertion of non-comparable objects 
  (doing so may result in ClassCastException).
