this concept is also introduced in java 1.5v.
the main objective of Generics is to achieve typesafty.

It makes the code stable by detecting the bugs at compile time.

Generics concept mostly used with collection f/w related classes, but we can 
apply the generics concept without collection f/w also.

Note: Generics concept is not applicable with primitive data types, it supports
only the obejcts.

we can create our own generic classes or generic methods. and that class or 
method can work with any kind of data.


adv of generics:
-------------------
1.type checking at compile time.
2.get rid of downcasting problem.

with this our code will become bug(most of them detected at compile time) free and more stable.

example :

MyGen.java:
-----------------

package com.masai;

public class MyGen<T> {
	
	T data;
	
	public MyGen(T data) {
		this.data=data;
	}
	
	public T getData() {
		return data;
	}

}
