5.What is the Difference between the sleep and join method .
	 There is a difference between join() and sleep(). join() 
	 will wait until the timeout expires or the thread finishes.
	 sleep() will just wait for the specified amount of time unless interrupted. 
	 So it is perfectly possible for join() 
	 to return much faster than the specified time.
	 
	 The reason why Netbeans warns you about sleep() and not about join() 
	 is precisely that difference. join() waits for something meaningful 
	 while sleep() just sits there doing nothing. If you aren't waiting for something,
	 then why would you want to wait at all? It is rarely meaningful,
	 hence the warning.
