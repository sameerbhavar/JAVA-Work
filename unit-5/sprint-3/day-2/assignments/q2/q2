2.What’s the difference between class lock and object lock?

	 In multithreading environment, two or more threads can access the shared 
	 resources simultaneously which can lead the inconsistent behavior of the system.
	 Java uses concept of locks to restrict concurrent access of shared resources or 
	 objects. Locks can be applied at two levels
	 
	 1.Object Level Locks − It can be used when you want non-static method or non-static block 
	   of the code should be accessed by only one thread.
	 2.Class Level locks − It can be used when we want to prevent multiple threads
	   to enter the synchronized block in any of all available instances on runtime. 
	   It should always be used to make static data thread safe.
