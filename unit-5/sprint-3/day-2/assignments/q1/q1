1)What is the difference between a synchronized method and a synchronized block?
	Synchronized block and synchronized methods are two ways to use synchronized keywords in Java and implement mutual exclusion 
	on critical sections of code. Since Java is mainly used to write multi-threading 
	programs,  which present various kinds of thread-related issues like thread-safety, 
	deadlock, and race conditions, which plagues into code mainly because of poor
	understanding of the synchronization mechanism provided by the Java programming 
	language.
