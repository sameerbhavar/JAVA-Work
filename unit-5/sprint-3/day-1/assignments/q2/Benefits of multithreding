2.Benefits of Multithreding?
Resource Sharing
	All the threads of a process share its resources such as memory, 
	data, files etc. A single application can have different threads
	within the same address space using resource sharing.
Responsiveness:
	 Program responsiveness allows a program to run even if part of it is blocked using
	 multithreading. This can also be done if the process is performing a lengthy 
	 operation. For example - A web browser with multithreading can 
	 use one thread for user contact and another for image loading at the same time	
Utilization of Multiprocessor Architecture:
	In a multiprocessor architecture, each thread can run on a different processor 
	in parallel using multithreading. This increases concurrency of the system. 
	This is in direct contrast to a single processor system, 
	where only one process or thread can run on a processor at a time.	 
Economy
	 It is more economical to use threads as they share the process resources.
	 Comparatively, it is more expensive and time-consuming to create processes as 
	 they require more memory and resources. The overhead for process creation and
	 management is much higher than thread creation and management.
