) Differentiate between the Thread class and Runnable interface for creating a
Thread?
	1.When we extend Thread class, we canâ€™t extend any other class even we require and 
	When we implement Runnable, we can save a space for our class 
	to extend any other class in future or now.
	2.When we extend Thread class, each of our thread creates unique object 
	and associate with it. When we implements Runnable, it shares the same 
	object to multiple threads.
