Question 2:
Briefly explain the difference between Early and Late Binding with examples

Early binding and late binding are two concept releted to polymorphism.

What is Early Binding?

In early binding he class information is used to resolve method calling.early binding ocuurs at compile
time .it is also knwon as the static binding.in this process the binding ocuurs beore the program actualy runs.
overloading method are bonded using early binding

Example:

cal.java

pakage com.masai

public class Cal
{
	public int add(int x,int y)
	{
	return x+y;
	}
	
	public double add(double x,double y)
	{
	return x+y;
	}
}
-------------------------------------------------

Main.java

pakage com.masai

public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
	Cal c = new cal();
	int ans1=cal.add(1,2);
	
	double ans2=cal.add(5.5,6.6);.
	syso("int ans"+ans1);
	syso("double ans":ans2);
	
	}
======================================================================================================================================

What is late Binding?

In the late binding the object is to resolved method calling.late binding ocuures at runtime
it is also known as dynamic binding.in this time the binding ocuures when program exution time.
overrddin method are bonded using the late binding

Example:

Shape.java

pakage com.masai

Public class Shape
{
public void draw()
{
syso("Draw Shape");
}
}
---------------------------------------


circle.java
pakage com.masai

public class Circle extends Shape
{
Public void draw()
{
}
syso("Draw circle");
}	
	
}
----------------------------------------

Main.java

Public Class Main
{
	public Static void main(String[] args)
	{
	Shape s;
	s=new Shape();
	s.draw();
	
	s= new Circle();
	s.draw();
	
	
	}

}
