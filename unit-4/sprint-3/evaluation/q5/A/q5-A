Question 5:
a) Does the below code compile successfully? If not, why?


interface A{
int i = 111;
}

class B implements A{
void methodB(){
i = 222;

Answer:

No ,this program cannot compile successFully
Because If we define any variable inside the interface this variable default public static final.
Thats why we cannot Reassign the value.
