Q3) Explain the difference between equals() and HashCode() Method.

The equals is similar to the == operator, which is to test for object identity rather than object equality.
 The hashCode is a method by which a class implicitly or explicitly break down the data stored in an instance of the class into a single hash value, which is a 32 bit signed integer. The key difference between equals and hashCode in Java is that the equals is used to compare two objects while the hashCode is
 used in hashing to decide which group an object should be categorized into.
 
 
  What is equals in Java?
The equals method is used to compare two objects. The default equals method is defined in the object class. 
That implementation is similar to the == operator. The two object references are equal only if they are pointing to the same object. 
It is possible to override the equals method.

What is hashCode in Java?
The hashCode is used in hashing to decide to which group an object should be categorized into.
 A group of objects can share the same hashCode.
 A correct hashing function can evenly distribute objects into different groups.
