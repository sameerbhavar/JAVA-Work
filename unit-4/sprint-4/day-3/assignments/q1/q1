Q1) Explain the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList

ArrayList and LinkedList both implement the List interface and maintain insertion order. 
Both are non-synchronized classes.

Arraylist
1.1) ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements.
2) Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses an array. If any element is removed from the array,
 all the other elements are shifted in memory.
3) An ArrayList class can act as a list only because it implements List only.
4) ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.


linkedlist
1.LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.
2)Manipulation with LinkedList is faster than ArrayList because it uses a doubly linked list,
 so no bit shifting is required in memory.
3)LinkedList class can act as a list and queue both because it implements List and Deque interfaces. 
4)LinkedList is better for manipulating data.
