Q3) Explain AutoBoxing and Auto UnBoxing with Examples

In Java, primitive data types are treated differently so do there comes the introduction of wrapper classes where two components play a role namely Autoboxing and Unboxing. Autoboxing refers to the conversion of a primitive value into an object of the corresponding wrapper class is called autoboxing. For example, converting int to Integer class. The Java compiler applies autoboxing when a primitive value is: 

Passed as a parameter to a method that expects an object of the corresponding wrapper class.
Assigned to a variable of the corresponding wrapper class.
Unboxing on the other hand refers to converting an object of a wrapper type to its corresponding primitive value. For example conversion of Integer to int. The Java compiler applies to unbox when an object of a wrapper class is: 

Passed as a parameter to a method that expects a value of the corresponding primitive type.
Assigned to a variable of the corresponding primitive type.
