Q1) Explain about the Marker interface?

An interface that does not contain methods, fields, and constants is known as marker interface. 
In other words, an empty interface is known as marker interface or tag interface.
 It delivers the run-time type information about an object.
  It is the reason that the JVM and compiler have additional information about an object.
  The Serializable and Cloneable interfaces are the example of marker interface. In short,
 it indicates a signal or command to the JVM.
